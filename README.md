# DemKG extensions ontology

The extensions ontology for the DemKG framework. This ontology implements necessary class definitions and axioms to complement the knowledge framework provided by the set of domain ontologies included in DemKG (see KG-Builder for more details). 

The ontology building is based on the [Ontology Development Kit (ODK)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit). The main entry point is [src/ontology/demkg-edit.owl](src/ontology/demkg-edit.owl). Many class definitions employ [DOSDP patterns](https://incatools.github.io/dead_simple_owl_design_patterns/overview/), implemented in [src/patterns](src/patterns).
